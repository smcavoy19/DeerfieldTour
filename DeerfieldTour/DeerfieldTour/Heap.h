//Removes and returns the maximum value (max-heap) or the minimum value (min-heap). To fill up the hole that's left by removing the element, the very last element is moved to the root position and then shiftDown() fixes up the heap. (This is sometimes called "extract min" or "extract max".)
-(Vertex *)remove;

//Just like remove() except it lets you remove any item from the heap, not just the root. This calls both shiftDown(), in case the new element is out-of-order with its children, and shiftUp(), in case the element is out-of-order with its parents.
-(Vertex *)removeAt:(int)index;

//Assigns a smaller (min-heap) or larger (max-heap) value to a node. Because this invalidates the heap property, it uses shiftUp() to patch things up. (Also called "decrease key" and "increase key".)
